# Code Translator
This is the application I've made from my own module that was made for translating between English and different codelanguages such as Morsecode.

## Installing
1. Copy the repository [GitHub](https://github.com/steiboldt/labb2)
2. Open a terminal window in the folder you want to clone it into.
3. `git clone https://github.com/steiboldt/labb2` to clone the project.` 

4. `npm install ` In the terminal to install dependencies.

5. `npm start` to start the application.
## Description 
The idea with this application is to be able to translate English to codelanguages, and codelanguages to English using the terminal. 

## Using the application 
The application has two different use-areas. Choosing to translate from English, or from Codelanguages. Which are selected at the start of the application. 

English to codelanguages: You are first prompted to input a string. Which you can then translate to any of the implemented codelanguages. You can then keep the same string to translate to other languages, or input a new string to translate.

Codelanguages to English: Here you first choose which Codelanguage you would like to translate from, and then you input the symbols for the specific codelanguage you've chosen.

## Technologies
This application is built using **Node**, **JavaScript** and **Prompt-Sync** to take inputs via the terminal.
